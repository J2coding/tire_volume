"""
You work for a retail store that wants to increase sales on Tuesday and Wednesday, which are the store's slowest sales days. On Tuesday and Wednesday, if a customer's subtotal is $50 or greater, the store will discount the customer's subtotal by 10%.

Core RequirementsÂ¶
1.Your program asks the user for the subtotal but does not ask the user for the day of the week. Your program gets the day of the week from your computer's operating system.
2.Your program correctly computes and prints the discount amount if applicable.
3.Your program correctly computes and prints the sales tax amount and the total amount due.
